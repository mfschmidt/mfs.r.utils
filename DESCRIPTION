Description: mfs_r_utils is a collection of functions written for myself to make
    my code cleaner, more concise, and consistent. Most of this package just
    wraps complex ggplot2 plots into simple functions with
    reasonable defaults so I can call them cleanly without wasting dozens of
    lines of code to redefine colors and themes. They also often overlay
    several plots so one mfs_r_utils plot is a one-stop-shop for information.
